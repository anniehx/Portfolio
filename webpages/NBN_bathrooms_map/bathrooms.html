                        <br>
                        <i><b>The privacy</b></i>
                        <br>
                        An anxious shitter’s dream. Single stall, not one but two locks, sturdy wooden door and an exit that can’t be seen from any nearby classrooms.
                        <br> <br> 
                        <i><b>Odor</i></b>
                        <br>
                        Clean and relatively scent-free. Harris, home to the History department, is a civilized place, so no one is sprinkling their tinkle* on the floor.
                        <br><br>
                        <i><b>Internet</i></b>
                        <br>
                        Everything streams just fine. TikTok, videos on Angry Birds hacks, piss… 
                        <br> <br>
                        <i><b>Lighting</i></b>
                        <br>
                        Serene. Indirect lighting emanates from above the porcelain throne, which is tucked away in a cozy corner banked by walls of retro tile. 
                        <br> <br>
                        <i><b>Excitement</i></b>
                        <br>
                        No rush. Relaxing. There’s never a line in Harris, because who the fuck majors in history. 
                        <br> <br>
                        <i><b>The comfort</i></b>
                        <br>
                        Warm. Cozy. Throw a futon in there and I’m moving in. 
                        
                        </p>

                        <i><b>The privacy</i></b>
                        <br>
                        The lock is totally non-functional, absolutely begging a turd burglar* to catch you in the act. The door is unreachable from the toilet, which means holding it shut is impossible. This is by far the most dangerous place to shit on campus.
                        <br> <br>
                        <i><b>Odor</i></b>
                        <br>
                        Could only smell the scent of my own cold, fearful sweat as I waited for someone to open the door on me. 
                        <br> <br>
                        <i><b>Internet</i></b>
                        <br>
                        Too stressed to scroll.
                        <br><br>
                        <i><b>Lighting</i></b>
                        <br>
                        Flickering corporate overheads. Ominous. Suited to the space. 
                        <br> <br>
                        <i><b>Excitement</i></b>
                        <br>
                        It is the only bathroom in the building, meaning the occupants of the 289 auditorium seats are all vying for a singular porcelain one. Beware. 
                        <br> <br>
                        <i><b>The comfort</i></b>
                        <br>
                        Normally the toilet’s position, nestled behind a corner, would provide a pleasantly cozy enclave. In this case, it works against the shitter, forcing an intruder to open the door and step inside before meeting your guilty eyes.

                        <i><b>The privacy</b></i>
                        <br>
                        Private, but in an isolating way. If the massive cockroach I saw had attacked I would’ve been fucked.
                        <br> <br>
                        <i><b>Odor</b></i>
                        <br> 
                        If the bowels of a building could stink, this bathroom would have been putrid. Fortunately, the pipes I could see through a giant hole in the ceiling were more of a visual offense than an olfactory one. 
                        <br> <br>
                        <i><b>Internet</b></i>
                        <br> 
                        Poor. The underground signal sucks. Couldn’t call for help. 
                        <br> <br>
                        <i><b>Lighting</b></i>
                        <br> 
                        No lighting inside the stalls. Dim and scary. There is a decently-lit full-length mirror — an amenity lacking in most campus bathrooms — but the other restroom offenses I encountered made me wonder whether the only comfort Lunt affords its female students is a place to do a ‘fit check. 
                        <br> <br>
                        <i><b>Excitement</b></i>
                        <br> 
                        The ceiling hole provides a perfect passage for a resident spider, mouse, or other Lunt fauna to descend mid-sewer pickle.* Exciting in a scary way. 
                        <br> <br>
                        <i><b>The comfort</b></i>
                        <br> 
                        If Harry Potter’s cupboard under the stairs was a bathroom, it would be this one. The slanted ceiling had me ducking my way into a stall, which forced me into closer proximity to the floor, where the cockroach threatened to join me for a tandem poop.
                        <br> <br>
                        * Uncomfortable on many levels.

                        <i><b>The privacy</b></i>
                        <br>
                        You know how the British say privacy? Exactly. It’s spacious enough to hide from the Louboutin- wearing business students that know I shouldn’t be there.
                        <br><br>
                        <i><b>Odor</b></i>
                        <br>
                         Smells like success. With the amount of money Northwestern invests in the business school, I would expect nothing less.
                        <br><br>
                        <i><b>Internet</b></i>
                        <br>
                         I took an international call, had a really wonderful conversation about the stock market. Felt fitting.
                        <br><br>
                        <i><b>Lighting</b></i>
                        <br>
                         Ringing up the girlies and pregaming in the Kellogg Bathroom for the selfie lighting. The mirror looks like a vanity, which is perfect for self-absorbed undergraduates (me!)
                        <br><br>
                        <i><b>Excitement</b></i>
                        <br>
                         The feng shui was top-tier. I felt very at peace.
                        <br><br>
                        <i><b>The comfort</b></i>
                        <br>
                        If bathrooms could give hugs, Kellogg would be akin to a corporate Paddington bear. No complaints.

                        There are often lines out the door, which usually means having a rushed, stressful trip to the bathroom. I can feel the judgment of the people in line when I take more than 2 minutes. Atrocious. .25/10 stars.
                        <br><br>

                        It is so musty in there, can Norris please invest in air fresheners before they build another Starbucks?

                        <i><b>Internet</b></i>
                        <br>
                        No bars, no service. A crime. What is a trip to the bathroom if not a social media binge?
                        <br><br>

                        If The Shining had a baby with the color yellow. Why would you ever paint a bathroom chartreuse? Everyone looks like they have jaundice. So disconcerting.

                        The cacophony of this bathroom truly threw me for a loop. Why is it shaped like an F? I was excited to leave.
                        <br><br>
                        <i><b>The comfort</b></i>

                        Legend has it that if you listen close enough, you can hear Moaning Myrtle complaining about the scalding water in the sink. As if it could get any worse. My recommendation, do not go piss girl. You can do better.

                        These bathrooms are such a well-kept secret that most people don’t even know they exist. To get there, take the elevator to the basement and turn left, then let it flow! Did I mention that these bad boys are single stall?
                        <br><br>

                        <br>
                        Since these johns are less frequently used, they probably get less cleaning service than most others.

                        Considering how off-the-grid and seemingly soundproof these bathrooms are, you could party in here until the AM!

                        <br>
                        For a long time, one of the two stalls in the second floor men’s bathroom had no functioning lock while the other stall had no functioning toilet seat. Thus, a diarrheal dilemma ensued. Sacrifice privacy for a place to park your rear? Or sacrifice your piss-covered ass so you don’t get walked in on?
                        <br><br>
                        <i><b>Odor</b></i>
                        <br>
                        Smells fine, probably because no one in their right mind would shit in here.

                        I’ll admit, there’s no rush quite like pooping where anyone can walk in on you

                        There’s nothing worse than entering a bathroom and getting an eerie feeling that you’re a part of some psycho Medill student’s fucked-up social experiment.

                        <br>
                        The tall door entrance is the first sign of luxury, and the door’s thickness muffles all of the sounds you might produce in this late-night safe space

                        <i><b>Odor</b></i>
                        <br>
                        Whatever they’re feeding the kids in Allison slips right by with no scent. All I can smell is whatever’s cooking up from the kitchen outside, which sometimes smells worse than a plop

                        The TikToks I made in this bathroom post in less than thirty seconds, which is a record speed for eduroam

                        <br>
                        The ceiling and mirror lights are bright and flattering. There’s something in that lighting that clears up your complexion in the mirror. If you make any TikToks like I mentioned above, the lighting will chisel your jawline.  Skip whatever depression lamp appointment SPAC offers and bring your sculpted booty over here

                        Many theater majors hang out around here, so depending on who you are, that can suck the life out of you or add some Broadway magic to your shitting experience

                        <i><b>The comfort</b></i>
                        <br>
                        Unless you’re in the handicap stall, these stalls have some wide cracks in the doors, so there’s a chance you’ll make eye contact with someone during the act.

                        <i><b>The privacy</b></i>
                        <br>
                        Well, someone has walked in on me multiple times in this bathroom. And after large lectures, you become trapped in a revolving door of people.
                        <br><br>
                        <i><b>Odor</b></i>
                        <br>
                        To be fair, I don’t think I’ve ever detected a stench in this bathroom. But also women don’t poop so maybe that’s why
                        <br><br>
                        <i><b>Internet</b></i>
                        <br>
                        Usually too overwhelmed by Tech’s stressful environment to even go on my phone.
                        <br><br>
                        <i><b>Lighting</b></i>
                        <br>
                        Cold and aloof, will make you think only of the aerodynamics of your plop
                        <br><br>
                        <i><b>Excitement</b></i>
                        <br>
                        One of the stalls (the one I used) does not lock properly, so mid-pee, prepare that door to swing right open at you. Pretty exhilarating. 
                        <br><br>
                        <i><b>The comfort</b></i>
                        <br>
                        The stressful vibes of Tech seep into the whole pre to post bowel movement experience. The toilet seats are chilly, fitting for the cold environment. When it’s time to wash your hands, you can’t help but make awkward mirror eye contact with the other two people wedged against you.
